# WalkingRobots

The robots move in a plane, and their starting position is (0; 0). Each robot can move a certain ¯
the number of steps in the directions: up (‘UP’), down (‘DO’), left (‘L’) and right (‘R’). The file is given below
called "test01.in". The file contains a list of commands for several robots, each on a separate line.
Each piece begins with the code of the robot to which the price is directed. Tags are in format format
R # where # represents the one-digit number of the robot. This is followed by an empty space and then one of four
directions of movement. Then there is an empty space and the number of steps that the robot makes in that direction.
It is necessary to write a program that will read such a file and print the distance from the origin (0; 0), to the point where the robot stopped, for each robot. When printing robots are
sort and print in separate lines with the corresponding distance.
